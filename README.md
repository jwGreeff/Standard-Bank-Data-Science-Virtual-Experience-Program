# Standard Bank Data Science Virtual Experience Program

<br><b>Objective: </b>To improve the process, Standard Bank wants to make use of machine learning to assess the creditworthiness of an applicant by implementing a model that will predict if the potential borrower will default on his/her loan or not, and do this such that they receive a response immediately after completing their application.<br>

Following topics are explored: <br><br>
<b>Task 1 - SQL for Data Scientists</b><br>
- Answering questions on SQL's implementation in a datascience project within the CRISP-DM framework.

<b>Task 2 - Data Science with Python (AutoML vs Bespoke ML)</b><br>
- Make use of automated machine learning as well as traditional machine learning. The manager of the home loans department, who has provided us with sample data, wants to know a few things about the data.  
- The manager is also interested in understanding what machine learning really is with particular use case.
- We will use Python and its extensive collection of libraries to derive valuable insights from the data, prepare the data and train machine learning models - the old fashioned way and in newer, automated ways. 

<b>Task 3 - Preparing To Present</b><br>
- Make a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation on the findings.

<b>Task 4 - Putting It All Together</b><br>
- Record a 5min to 15min video presentation of your findings.
